## Implementation Plan

### Features

### Kanban Schedule

Initial task list with all the tasks I could think of in the backlog

I moved all the tasks required for a minimum viable product into the To-Do area
!["Kanban 2"](./img/Kanban(2).png)

Started implementing the squizData module & json, as it's very foundational to a lot of my other modules & will make testing them easier
!["Kanban 3"](./img/Kanban(3).png)

Began testing & implementing the json & data, ran into issues with my JSON file not using proper syntax which I only found when testing the data module. Added some error handling for missing files.

Finished implementing the basic template for quizes & reading them into a list variable using the squizData module. Time to work on the basics of displaying questions
